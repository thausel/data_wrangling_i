library(tidyverse)

### Read in some data

Read in the litters dataset and clean it using clean_names (e.g., turns titles in snakecase)

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

## Take a look at data

Printing in the console, so you can see everything that is going in
```{r}
litters_df
```

Look at head/tail of the litters dataset
```{r}
tail(litters_df)
```

Gives a nice overview of the data
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```

View the data in a separate tab using view (dataframe_name) --> but only do that in the console or else the it can mess up the knitting process

## Options to view data

Skip first row , make sure first row is not taken as names , empty values show up as NA

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv", skip = 10, col_names = FALSE, na = c("", "NA", ".", 999))
```
